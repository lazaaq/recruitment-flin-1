## Description :
This application is a chatbot simulation where users can ask/FAQ via chat on the bottom right side. As for asking questions, users can click on the question they want to ask. Users cannot type because if users type, the system is still not smart enough to answer random questions. AI is needed if you want to allow users to ask questions outside of those presented.

## How to Install :
